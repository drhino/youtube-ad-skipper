# youtube-ad-skipper
Skip to the end of an ad as soon as it plays. I'm not sure how long this will be effective, but it is currently working.

# installation
This isn't available on any extension store, so you will have to install it manually.
## firefox
1. Open about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
2. Click "Load Temporary Add-on..."
3. Open the folder "youtube-ad-skipper-firefox" (selecting any file within the folder auto selects the folder)
<br><br>
With this method you will need to re-do this every time you start your browser.

## brave
1. Open brave://extensions
2. Click "Load unpacked" button
3. select the folder "youtube-ad-skipper-chrome"

# usage
If there are any remaining ads you can remove every ad within the adElements array by right clicking anywhere and clicking "Remove Remaining Ads."
